# CE-voteTools

### A CobaltEssentials extension to provide vote-based tools on BeamMP Servers

## Installation:

#### 1. Place voteTools.lua in
`.../Resources/Server/CobaltEssentials/extensions/`

#### 2. Add an entry to turn it on in:
`.../Resources/Server/CobaltEssentials/LoadExtensions.cfg`

```cfg
# Add your new extensions here as a key/value pair
# The first one is the name in the lua enviroment
# The second value is the file path to the main lua from CobaltEssentials/extensions

exampleExtension = "exampleExtension"
voteTools = "voteTools"
```
---
## Configuration:
At the top of voteTools.lua you will see some configurables:

```lua
--config these to your preference
local voteKickTimeout = 60 --how long in seconds a voteKick is open
local immuneLevel = 2 --this CE player permission level and above cannot be voted for
local voteKickRatio = 0.3 --what percent of connected players must vote for a candidate for them to be kicked

local voteMapTimeout = 60 --how long in seconds a voteMap is open
local voteMapRatio = 0.5 --what percent of connected players must vote for a map for the map to change
```
---
## Usage:
By default, Everyone can initiate voteKick and voteMap. I made this decision because the point of voting is that players on a server should be able to use these without the need for mods or admins to be present.

* voteKick uses IDs instead of names, because some names can be difficult to type.

* voteMap uses shortNames for ease of use.

This extension's commands and aliases are:

`/votekick` or `/vk`

`/vote` or `/v`

`/votecancel` or `/vc`

`/votemap` or `/vm`

`/changemap` or `/cm`

`/maps` or `/map` or `/maplist` or `/ml`

* To start a voteKick, any player may use `/votekick` or `/vk`. This will print the list of players currently on the server, and give usage instructions for `/vote`.

* When a voteKick is active, players may use `/vote <playerID>` to vote for a player.

* To start a voteMap, any player may use `/voteMap` or `/vm`. This will print the list of maps, and give usage instructions for `/vote`.

* When a voteMap is active, players may use `/vote <shortName>` to vote for a map.

* After a configurable length of time (60 seconds by default), the vote will reset, or server mod/admin/owner can use `/votecancel` at any time.

* Admins can directly change a map with `/changemap <shortName>` or `/cm <shortName>`

* Anyone can check the shortName/fullName pairs with `/maps` or `/map` or `/maplist` or `/ml`
